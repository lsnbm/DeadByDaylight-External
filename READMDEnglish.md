## üîç Project Overview

Dead by Daylight External Overlay is an external rendering tool for *Dead by Daylight*.
It uses a custom kernel driver to perform direct physical memory reads and writes to obtain in‚Äëgame entity data for rendering.
Rendering is built on the [noahware/external-overlay](https://github.com/noahware/external-overlay) framework.
For the latest offsets, please refer to [Encryqed/Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7).

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUser/DbD-External-Overlay.git
   cd DbD-External-Overlay
   ```

2. **Prepare the kernel driver**

   > *This project provides only the external overlay code, no driver included.*
   > Please set up or use your own driver template, ensure it's properly signed and loaded:

   * Example driver: `YourKernelDriver.sys`
   * Driver API: custom `ReadPhysicalMemory` / `WritePhysicalMemory`

3. **Configure offsets**
   Keep offsets up to date by downloading and parsing:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7.git
   # Generate latest offsets.json with Dumper-7 tool
   cp Dumper-7/offsets.json config/offsets.json
   ```
